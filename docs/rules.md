# General

The jam will start on YYYY-MM-DD please do not do any work until then.

The jam will end on YYYY-MM-DD.

There will be a beta-build released before the final public release, so that mappers can test and be sure the pre-release is working as expected.

`track255` is a null/blank track, feel free to use it to cut your music or start your level without music.

You may claim any unclaimed track number between 12 and 254
